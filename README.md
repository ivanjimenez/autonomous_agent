# Autonomous Agent Valory X-Y-Z Challenge

### Assumptions and decisions

- The code is decoupled in agent, behaviours and handlers modules with its respectives Interfaces/Abstract clases
- Each module has an implementation of an agent, handler or behaviour given in the current challenge.
- The architecture to run and manage agents is based on asynchronous queues (asyncio.queue) and tasks (asyncio).
- Not threads or multiprocesses are used, but these options could be used in the future to take advantage of multicore/multiprocess arquitectures. 
- `simple_agent.py` works with the AbstractClasses to decouple any implementation. 
- `main.py` is the main point to run the application. I think there are comments in each module but I would make some explanations in RUN section

### RUN

* Just execute main.py: `python main.py` (a console output is provided below)
* Two agents are running in asynchronous tasks.

* Every message create has the following format:
    - <date_time> <log_level> <agent_name> <sending/received> <message> id <unique_id>
* Unique id is created when a message is generated and after is sent to the queue. The other agente receives the 
message and print it. **This is because the output is showed clearly and any message are checked if it is lost or wrong/not sent/not received**.

* There is a callback called in 10 seconds once. **This is because I want to demonstrate that handle or/and 
behaviours could be updated in agents while they are running without cancelling tasks or creating new instances.**

* Also, coloured messages help to identificate sent/received messages.

* In the example below you can see the behaviour/handle given in the current challenge and after the callback is called, behaviour/handle are setted to new values. You can pass any implementation of handle/behaviour.

* Tasks could be stop comfortably and safely in console with CTRL+C keys.
* After that you will obtain some performance and time stats.
* Performance and time stats are calculated when agents are executing.

### Tests

- Test framework used for testing: `unittest`
- For some issues (needing of improvements), please run each test separately as follows:
    
    * Unit Test both agents: there are other tests in test folder to check behaviour and handle it is necessary. 
    ```
    python -m unittest .\tests\test_agents.py                
    ######### Starting Unit Tests
    Configured Agent1 and Agent2.
    .Agent1 behaviour configured
    .Agent2 behaviour configured
    .Agent1 handle configured
    .Agent1 handle configured
    .
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 5 tests in 0.006s

    OK
    ```
    ---
    
    * Integration Test: agent1 and agent2 are instantiated and runned with asyncronous tasks in the event loop. 
    The standard output of these tasks are recorded in `agent_logs.log` for testing purposes. The aim of the test is checking if behaviours and handles are working in real time while agents are sending/receiving messages. The execution of these tasks are limited to 10 secondes and then tasks are cancelled. The file has the output and after FOUND/NOT FOUND are counted to verify handle/behaviour are working.

    Sure Tests can be improved to check real scenarios properly. But I think this test could be fine by now. 
    ```
    $ python -m unittest .\tests\test_integration.py

### Improvements

- To create a Task Runner Class
- To create Thread Executor/Multiprocessing to take advantage of multicore architectures.
- To improve unit/integration tests.
